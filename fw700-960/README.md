# PSFree WebKit Exploit & Lapse Kernel Exploit v2.04 for PS4

A PSFree & Lapse exploit for PS4 firmware 7.00 to 9.60
> ⚠️ This repository is for research and educational purposes only.

## Overview
This repository is a research-focused fork of [PSFree](https://github.com/kmeps4/PSFree) that aims to improve the reliability and success rate of existing public exploit code. The project’s main motivation is twofold:

1. **increase stability and success rate** through timing, error-handling and reliability improvements.

2. **reduce platform compatibility requirements** by converting the existing `.mjs` modular structure into plain `.js`. The result is less modular structure but is more portable codebase.

Through these changes, the original modular `.mjs` structure has been refactored into a single-file `.js` implementation designed to execute in a more sequential, `C-like` flow. This approach improves readability, simplifies debugging and ensures consistent execution timing across environments.

## Major Changes

- **Removed all** `.mjs` **files** — converted the codebase to plain `.js` to improve cross-platform compatibility and simplify loading requirements.
- **Refactored for more sequential** `C-like` **execution** — code reorganized to follow a linear flow for easier reasoning, deterministic timing, and simpler debugging.
- **Rewrote** `Number.isInteger()` **implementation** — The original exploit implementation relied on `Number.isInteger()`, which I guess not fully supported in the PS4’s WebKit-based JavaScript environment (situated between `ES5` and `Partial ES6` compliance). To ensure consistent behavior across these runtimes, the function was rewritten using fundamental type and arithmetic checks. This guarantees proper integer validation even in restricted or legacy WebKit engines.
- **Rewrote** `hexdump()` **implementation** — adjusted string/byte handling to comply with the PS4’s WebKit-based JavaScript environment.
- **Improved GC handling with short delay** — added a small wait (≈50 ms) to certain `gc()` paths to stabilize memory reclamation timing.
- **Added initialization checks for variable operations** — guard checks ensure variables are initialized before use to prevent undefined-state failures.
- **Reordered and cleaned global variable initializations** — made global setup deterministic and reduced race conditions at startup.
- **Added parentheses to some of the logic expressions** — explicit grouping was added to prevent operator-precedence ambiguities and reduce logic errors.
- **Removed debugging logs** — cleaned up and commented out debugging logs to reduce side effects and improve runtime consistency.
- **Embedded** `.elf/.bin` **assets as hex arrays inside JS** — binary resources converted to in-file hex arrays to avoid read/load errors in constrained environments.
- **Replaced** `XMLHttpRequest()` **with** `fetch()`**/file reads** — modernized file-loading code for better compatibility and promise-based control flow.
- **Removed all** `localStorage` **and** `sessionStorage` **usage** — Storage APIs were removed to avoid cross-origin restrictions, quota issues, and inconsistent behavior in sandboxed WebKit environments.
- **Implemented console firmware detection** — Added logic to automatically detect the running PS4 firmware version, enabling conditional execution paths and improving overall compatibility across different system revisions.
- **Merged various tweaks from Al-Azif’s source** — Incorporated selected stability, compatibility, and workflow improvements from Al-Azif’s implementation to enhance overall reliability and reduce edge-case failures.
- **Added multi-firmware support (7.00 -> 9.60) from Al-Azif’s source** — Full support implemented for firmware versions 7.00 through 9.60, including: Kernel patch + AIO fix .bin files

## ToDo List

- Add 6.XX support

## Notes:

> All payload binaries (`*.bin`, `*.elf`) were intentionally excluded.
> Step-by-step jailbreak instructions were omitted for legal and ethical compliance.  
> No modifications that alter the exploit logic in ways affecting device security outside test context.
